◦ Multimodal Retrieval: Engineered a document retrieval system using ResNet CNN for feature extraction in image and TF-IDF for text processing, resulting in over 90% composite similarity for matching query images and text.
◦ Product recommendation System: Used collaborative filtering techniques to recommend relevant items by analysing user interactions and preferences. Matching users with similar histories resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.3
◦ Review Summarisation using GPT-2: Constructed a review summariser through a customised GPT-2 model by creating custom data classes and experimenting with model hyperparameters, resulting in a Rouge Score of 55%.
